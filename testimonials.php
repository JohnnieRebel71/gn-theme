                <b>Dustan Got The Job Done For Me</b><br>
                I actively sought an attorney who could help me with my DWI case. At the time, I was freaking out about my case and what the future held for me. I met with Dustan days later and he couldn't of been more helpful and knowledgeable concerning these types of cases. He was with me every step of the way, from reviewing the police tapes through the two meetings in court. The courts had two charges against me: the first was whether or not I was guilty of DWI and the other dealt with my license because I refused a breathalyzer. He got both of them dismissed!!! I would highly recommend Dustan to anyone who was put in my situation. Thanks again Dustan.

                <b>Knowledgable Trustworthy Attorney</b><br>
                I owe Dustan much gratitude. I was the victim of a person that had maliscious intent and was using the court system in an attempt to achieve what she wanted. I contacted about forty to fifty different attorneys before speaking with Dustan Neyland. From the second that I began explaining my case to him I could feel the sincere concern in his voice. Through out the entire nightmare he was right there to answer my questions and provide me with the comfort that one seeks when facing adversity with the justice system. Ultimately, the end result was a dissmissal of my case. I would recommend the services of Dustan Neyland to anyone. To me it seems that he takes his clients cases personal and provides results. Thank you again Dustan for your help I am forever grateful........<br>

                <b>Dustan Neyland was the best decission we could had made!!</b><br>
                Mr. Neyland was the exact opposite of what I was lead to believe all my life about Attorneys .(and politicians) From our very 1st visit he was very attentive, knowledgeable, and re-assuring to both my Husband and Myself. Anytime I called him he would either immediately answer or call or text me within 5 mins. I can't express enough how reassuring and honest Mr. Neyland was throughout my very stressful legal issues! I would not hesitate to recommend him or use him myself, as a personal Attorney in the future!<br>
